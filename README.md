# bfb-blender

A toolset for blender allowing the import export of Zoo Tycoon 2 models and animations, as well as maps and particle systems (experimental!).

### Installation
- Click the `Clone or Download` button at the right, then `Download ZIP`.
- To install with the addon installer in Blender, click `File` > `User Preferences` > `Add-ons` > `Install Add-ons from File` and select the ZIP you just downloaded.

### How To Use
#### Importing Models
- `File` > `Import` > `Blue Fang Model (.bfb)`. Import from a Z2F-like file structure. BFB models rely on a `Materials` folder containing `.bfmat` files; both materials and textures may be `shared` between different objects! The default settings should be fine. Refer to the tooltips of the import options for further information.
#### Exporting Models
- `File` > `Export` > `Blue Fang Model (.bfb)`. The default settings should be fine. Sometimes you want to fiddle with / disable the LOD settings, eg. if you created custom / edited the generated LODs.

### Known Limitations
- This version is NOT backwards compatible - this was required to properly fix animation import. Rigged models imported with the old version won't export correctly with this version, so export any WIPs you may have to BFB before upgrading. Then you can re-import them and resume work.

### Credits
- Papapanda, Harlequinz Ego & Verdant Gregor for decoding the bulk of the file format
- ZT2 was created by Blue Fang Games for Microsoft Studios.
